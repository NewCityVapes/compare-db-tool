  <p><em>Updated for 2025</em></p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>STLTH continues to innovate, and with the launch of the <strong>STLTH 60K</strong>, users now face a tough choice between it and the highly popular <strong>STLTH 8K PRO</strong>. Hereâ€™s a deep dive into the differences between STLTHâ€™s tech-forward disposables.</p>

  <h3>Design & Portability</h3>
  <p><strong>8K PRO</strong> features a modern form with a screen, airflow control, and recharge capability â€” sleek and compact. <strong>60K</strong> is larger due to the puff count, but still ergonomic with a higher-end finish and more detailed display.</p>

  <h3>Flavour Experience</h3>
  <p><strong>STLTH 60K</strong> improves on flavour saturation and coil performance. The dual mesh system delivers deep, long-lasting flavour across thousands of puffs. <strong>8K PRO</strong> is still exceptional, especially with airflow control, but 60K takes the edge for power users.</p>

  <div style=""background:#E5E5E5;padding:1rem;border-left:5px solid #CB9D64;margin:1.5rem 0;"">
    <h4>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:</h4>
    <p>If you want premium STLTH flavour that doesnâ€™t quit, <strong>60K</strong> is built for high-end, long-session vaping.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Performance & Battery Life</h3>
  <p><strong>8K PRO</strong> handles daily use well with 8000 puffs and fast USB-C charging. <strong>STLTH 60K</strong> offers over 7x that capacity, smart battery indicators, and better long-term value for frequent users.</p>

  <h3>Value for Money</h3>
  <p><strong>8K PRO</strong> is great for intermediate vapers or those testing the waters with STLTH. <strong>60K</strong> is more expensive, but ideal for power users who want durability, fewer replacements, and a richer flavour payoff.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p><strong>STLTH 8K PRO</strong> is the compact, controlled, and budget-friendly STLTH experience. <strong>STLTH 60K</strong> is a luxury vape built for serious vapers who want premium everything â€” flavour, features, and longevity.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>If youâ€™re choosing between the no-frills <strong>GHOST MEGA</strong> and the refined, punchy <strong>VICE BOX</strong>, this breakdown will help you decide what matters more â€” simplicity or sharp, modern flavour delivery.</p>

  <h3>Design & Portability</h3>
  <p><strong>GHOST MEGA</strong> is ultra-basic and compact â€” a true grab-and-go disposable. <strong>VICE BOX</strong> is more modern, with a sleek rectangular design that feels premium and offers better grip and airflow control.</p>

  <h3>Flavour Experience</h3>
  <p><strong>VICE BOX</strong> brings sweet, icy blends with great throat hit and consistent performance. <strong>GHOST MEGA</strong> delivers lighter flavours â€” decent for everyday use, but not as flavour-saturated as VICEâ€™s output.</p>

  <div style=""background:#E5E5E5;padding:1rem;border-left:5px solid #CB9D64;margin:1.5rem 0;"">
    <h4>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:</h4>

  </div>

  <h3>Performance & Battery Life</h3>

  <h3>Value for Money</h3>
  <p><strong>GHOST</strong> is more affordable and great for light users. <strong>VICE BOX</strong> gives better flavour, longevity, and design for those who vape more frequently.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p><strong>Choose GHOST MEGA</strong> for simplicity and budget-friendliness. Pick <strong>VICE BOX</strong> if you want better flavour, longer life, and a more modern vaping experience.</p>

  <h2>VICE vs FLIP 2 Vape: In-Depth Review</h2>
  <p><em>Updated for 2025</em></p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>With the surge in disposable vape innovation, finding the right device in 2025 means balancing puff count, portability, and flavour impact. Today, we compare the widely trusted <strong>VICE</strong> line with the sleek and compact <strong>FLIP 2</strong>. Letâ€™s break down which one deserves your next hit.</p>

  <h3>Design & Portability</h3>
  <p>The <strong>FLIP 2</strong> lives up to its name â€” itâ€™s incredibly pocket-friendly with a flip-top cover that keeps the mouthpiece clean. Its minimalist shape and lightweight build are great for users on the go.</p>
  <p><strong>VICE</strong> takes a more premium approach with its box-style design and durable casing. It may be bulkier, but it gives a more substantial feel in hand, with USB-C rechargeability as standard.</p>

  <h3>Flavour Experience</h3>
  <p><strong>FLIP 2</strong> excels at consistency, offering smooth hits with popular profiles like Mint Ice and Lush Kiwi. That said, <strong>VICE</strong> takes the edge with bolder, more complex flavour blends like Dragon Fruit Punch and Cherry Bomb â€” each one staying rich till the very last puff.</p>

  <div style=""background:#E5E5E5;padding:1rem;border-left:5px solid #CB9D64;margin:1.5rem 0;"">
    <h4>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:</h4>
    <p>If you're a flavour chaser who hates drop-off, <strong>VICE</strong> offers superior saturation all the way through â€” especially in fruit blends.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Performance & Battery Life</h3>
  <p><strong>VICE</strong> devices are known for high-capacity batteries and rechargeable convenience, giving you significantly more lifespan than FLIP 2â€™s single-use model. With FLIP 2, once the battery dies, youâ€™re done.</p>

  <h3>Value for Money</h3>
  <p><strong>FLIP 2</strong> comes in cheaper and works well for casual or beginner users. But for regular vapers, <strong>VICE</strong> provides more puffs, stronger flavour, and better reusability â€” making it the smarter investment over time.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>While FLIP 2 is great for convenience and stealth, VICE dominates in flavour, longevity, and satisfaction. If you're serious about vaping in 2025, <strong>VICE</strong> is the clear winner.</p>

  <h2>VICE vs ELF BAR BC10000 Vape: In-Depth Review</h2>
  <p><em>Updated for 2025</em></p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Two titans in the disposable vape world, <strong>VICE</strong> and <strong>ELF BAR BC10000</strong>, dominate conversations in 2025. While both deliver excellent puff counts and rich flavour, how do they stack up head-to-head? Letâ€™s dive into the differences that matter.</p>

  <h3>Design & Portability</h3>
  <p><strong>ELF BAR BC10000</strong> is sleek and ultra-modern, with an LED screen showing battery and juice levels â€” a first in disposables. <strong>VICE</strong> keeps it classic with solid construction and ergonomic comfort, but lacks the high-tech extras.</p>

  <h3>Flavour Experience</h3>
  <p>ELF BAR has carved a name for itself with flavours like Sakura Grape and Blue Cotton Candy â€” smooth, sweet, and layered. <strong>VICE</strong> isnâ€™t far behind, but its flavour blends tend to hit stronger and maintain their punch longer into the life of the device.</p>

  <div style=""background:#E5E5E5;padding:1rem;border-left:5px solid #CB9D64;margin:1.5rem 0;"">
    <h4>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:</h4>
    <p>If you're a numbers geek or want to monitor usage, the <strong>ELF BAR BC10000</strong>'s smart screen is a huge bonus.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Performance & Battery Life</h3>
  <p>Both vapes are rechargeable, but the <strong>ELF BAR BC10000</strong> edges out with longer-lasting performance and a smoother fade. VICE is reliable and quick-charging, though some users report slight inconsistencies toward the end of its cycle.</p>

  <h3>Value for Money</h3>
  <p>ELF BAR costs a bit more, but you get premium design and more puffs per device. <strong>VICE</strong> remains a budget-friendly option that still packs value, especially if you prefer bolder flavours over sleek hardware.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>If you love innovation, tech features, and smoother delivery, the <strong>ELF BAR BC10000</strong> is your best bet. But if rich flavours and affordability top your list, <strong>VICE</strong> still holds its own. This oneâ€™s a close call â€” and depends on your vaping style.</p>

  <h2>VICE vs Drip'n EVO Series 28K Vape: In-Depth Review</h2>
  <p><em>Updated for 2025</em></p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>As disposable vapes push the boundaries of performance and puff count, two giants stand out: the well-known <strong>VICE</strong> and the futuristic <strong>Dripâ€™n EVO Series 28K</strong>. Here's how they compare in real-world use and which one is worth your money in 2025.</p>

  <h3>Design & Portability</h3>
  <p>The <strong>Dripâ€™n EVO 28K</strong> is bold, futuristic, and slightly heavier, with LED indicators and a dynamic design. <strong>VICE</strong> is more compact and minimalist, better for users who prefer simplicity without sacrificing build quality.</p>

  <h3>Flavour Experience</h3>
  <p><strong>Dripâ€™n EVO</strong> brings next-gen flavour separation with dual mesh coils that keep flavours pure even after hundreds of puffs. VICE, however, delivers harder hits with intense fruit-forward flavours that satisfy heavy users.</p>

  <div style=""background:#E5E5E5;padding:1rem;border-left:5px solid #CB9D64;margin:1.5rem 0;"">
    <h4>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:</h4>
    <p>If youâ€™re a fan of high-tech vapes and want maximum flavour control, <strong>Dripâ€™n EVO</strong> is where innovation meets impact.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Performance & Battery Life</h3>
  <p>With up to 28,000 puffs, the <strong>Dripâ€™n EVO</strong> is engineered for marathon vaping. It offers longer lifespan and enhanced draw control. VICE provides solid performance, but can't match EVOâ€™s extended use and recharge cycle.</p>

  <h3>Value for Money</h3>
  <p>VICE is the budget-friendly warrior â€” great for day-to-day use. <strong>Dripâ€™n EVO</strong> comes at a premium, but offers more than double the performance, making it ideal for vapers who want more time between purchases.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>VICE remains a strong pick for everyday use, especially with bold flavours and consistent hits. But for power users who value longevity and innovation, <strong>Dripâ€™n EVO Series 28K</strong> is the future â€” and itâ€™s here.</p>

  <p><em>Updated for 2025</em></p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>For vapers chasing bold flavours and massive puff counts, the <strong>KRAZE HD MEGA 20K</strong> and <strong>STLTH TITAN MAX</strong> are two heavy hitters in 2025. Which one deserves your dollars? We put both to the test to find out.</p>

  <h3>Design & Portability</h3>
  <p>The <strong>STLTH TITAN MAX</strong> features a tall, cylindrical body and high-capacity feel. Itâ€™s rugged and easy to grip but may feel bulky in smaller hands. <strong>KRAZE HD MEGA 20K</strong>, on the other hand, balances high volume with a surprisingly compact chassis â€” ideal for discreet portability.</p>

  <h3>Flavour Experience</h3>
  <p>KRAZE brings strong contenders with icy blends and fruit-forward flavours that stay consistent throughout. STLTH is known for its smoother throat hits and curated flavours like Double Berry Ice and Mango Chill â€” making it ideal for all-day use.</p>

  <div style=""background:#E5E5E5;padding:1rem;border-left:5px solid #CB9D64;margin:1.5rem 0;"">
    <h4>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:</h4>
    <p>If throat hit and flavour comfort are high priorities, <strong>STLTH TITAN MAX</strong> is a more refined ride.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Performance & Battery Life</h3>
  <p>Both devices offer solid battery life with USB-C recharging, but <strong>KRAZE</strong> manages up to 20,000 puffs with excellent draw stability. STLTH TITAN MAX matches the power but can feel slightly muted after extended use.</p>

  <h3>Value for Money</h3>
  <p><strong>KRAZE</strong> is a price-per-puff king, offering high output at mid-tier cost. STLTH justifies its price with smoother experience and brand recognition, but may not last quite as long.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>If you're in it for sheer puff count and boldness, the <strong>KRAZE HD MEGA 20K</strong> edges ahead. But for a smoother, subtler vape with stylish design, <strong>STLTH TITAN MAX</strong> delivers a premium experience worth the tag.</p>

  <h3>Design & Portability</h3>
  <p>The <strong>CHILLA ZILLA 30K</strong> is massive â€” in both size and impact. Itâ€™s not the most pocketable, but it turns heads with its beastly design. <strong>FEED FREEZIE 25K</strong> is more subtle but still delivers on ergonomics and ease of carry.</p>

  <h3>Flavour Experience</h3>
  <p><strong>CHILLA ZILLA</strong> leans into cold, bold, menthol-style flavours like Frozen Grape and Arctic Melon. FEED FREEZIE offers a more balanced range with creamy and fruity tones that appeal to sweet lovers. CHILLA wins on intensity, while FREEZIE wins on smoothness.</p>

  <h3>Performance & Battery Life</h3>
  <p>FEED FREEZIE delivers 25,000 puffs with a dual-coil system and stable draw until the end. CHILLA ZILLA goes all the way to 30,000, but some users report a slight drop in flavour past the 20K mark. Still, both are rechargeable and marathon-ready.</p>

  <h3>Value for Money</h3>
  <p>CHILLA ZILLA offers more puffs for your dollar, while FEED FREEZIE leans into smoother flavour delivery and reliability. Both are excellent value, but your choice depends on what you prioritize: punch or polish.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>If power and puff count top your list, go with <strong>CHILLA ZILLA 30K</strong>. But for those who want a smoother, more balanced experience with less frostbite, <strong>FEED FREEZIE 25K</strong> wins the flavor game.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>2025 has brought a new wave of high-performance disposable vapes, and two strong contenders are the <strong>FEED SYNC 25K</strong> and the <strong>SLIM 7500</strong>. Both cater to power users, but the experience and value they offer differ dramatically. Here's our breakdown.</p>

  <h3>Design & Portability</h3>
  <p>The <strong>SLIM 7500</strong> stays true to its name â€” slim, pocketable, and sleek. It's an easy daily carry with minimal bulk. <strong>FEED SYNC 25K</strong> is slightly larger, built with a more robust feel and an LED puff tracker display that adds functionality at the cost of portability.</p>

  <h3>Flavour Experience</h3>
  <p><strong>SLIM 7500</strong> keeps it safe with a clean flavour lineup â€” expect Mango Ice, Grape, and cool menthol blends. <strong>FEED SYNC</strong> takes it further with vibrant, layered flavours and dual mesh coils for improved consistency over time.</p>

  <div style=""background:#E5E5E5;padding:1rem;border-left:5px solid #CB9D64;margin:1.5rem 0;"">

  <h3>Performance & Battery Life</h3>
  <p><strong>FEED SYNC 25K</strong> delivers up to 25,000 puffs with a rechargeable battery, excellent airflow control, and flavor that holds strong. <strong>SLIM 7500</strong> is respectable but maxes out much sooner, and lacks advanced control or reusability.</p>

  <h3>Value for Money</h3>
  <p>If you're after longevity and premium tech, <strong>FEED SYNC</strong> is worth the investment. <strong>SLIM 7500</strong> is a more budget-friendly option, better for short-term use or light vapers.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p><strong>SLIM 7500</strong> is ideal for casual users who prioritize size and simplicity. But if you're a frequent vaper looking for performance, tech, and true longevity, <strong>FEED SYNC 25K</strong> is the clear winner.</p>

  <h3>Design & Portability</h3>
  <p><strong>FLIP BAR</strong> is one of the most portable disposables available, featuring a flip-up mouthpiece and slim silhouette perfect for pockets and purses. <strong>STLTH 3K</strong> keeps its traditional pen-style shape but feels sturdier and more balanced in hand.</p>

  <h3>Flavour Experience</h3>
  <p>Both brands offer fruity and icy staples, but <strong>STLTH</strong> edges ahead with cleaner, smoother flavour profiles that donâ€™t overwhelm the senses. <strong>FLIP BAR</strong> hits a bit stronger, which some users love â€” but it can be a bit harsh for beginners.</p>

  <h2>VICE 5500 vs SLIM 7500 Vape: In-Depth Review</h2>
  <p><em>Updated for 2025</em></p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Mid-tier puff counts are dominating the disposable vape scene, and two crowd favourites are the <strong>VICE 5500</strong> and <strong>SLIM 7500</strong>. These vapes offer portability with solid performance â€” but which one delivers the best bang for your buck?</p>

  <h3>Design & Portability</h3>
  <p>The <strong>SLIM 7500</strong> is ultra-thin, built for stealth and ease. <strong>VICE 5500</strong> opts for a more ergonomic grip with a sturdy exterior, slightly bulkier but more premium in hand.</p>

  <h3>Flavour Experience</h3>
  <p><strong>VICE</strong> brings the heat with strong, juicy flavours like Dragonfruit Ice and Peach Lemonade. <strong>SLIM</strong> stays simple â€” clean hits, but lighter profiles overall. If bold flavour is your goal, VICE wins this category.</p>

  <div style=""background:#E5E5E5;padding:1rem;border-left:5px solid #CB9D64;margin:1.5rem 0;"">
    <h4>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:</h4>
    <p><strong>VICE 5500</strong> is ideal if you want bigger clouds and more intense flavour in fewer puffs.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Performance & Battery Life</h3>
  <p>SLIM 7500 offers more puffs on paper, but VICE is more consistent across the full life of the battery. Both are non-rechargeable, but VICE seems to extract more flavour per mL before tapering off.</p>

  <h3>Value for Money</h3>
  <p>SLIM 7500 gives you more total puffs, while <strong>VICE 5500</strong> provides a richer, punchier experience with fewer interruptions. It depends on what you value: longevity or intensity.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>If you prefer clean, mellow draws and maximum usage time, go with <strong>SLIM 7500</strong>. But for bold flavour lovers and performance seekers, <strong>VICE 5500</strong> is the way to go.</p>

  <h2>KRAZE 5000 vs LOST MARY OS5000 Vape: In-Depth Review</h2>
  <p><em>Updated for 2025</em></p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Two compact powerhouses, the <strong>KRAZE 5000</strong> and <strong>LOST MARY OS5000</strong>, are often compared in the mid-range disposable market. Both promise up to 5000 puffs and vibrant flavour â€” but one stands out in real-world use.</p>

  <h3>Design & Portability</h3>
  <p><strong>LOST MARY</strong> has a stylish gradient finish and oval body, making it one of the most iconic and comfortable designs in the space. <strong>KRAZE</strong> is more utilitarian â€” itâ€™s smaller and more pocketable, but doesnâ€™t turn heads quite like LOST MARY does.</p>

  <h3>Flavour Experience</h3>
  <p><strong>KRAZE</strong> hits sharp and fast â€” flavours like Strawberry Ice and Kiwi Berry Ice are punchy and fun. <strong>LOST MARY</strong> delivers a smoother, more layered flavour experience with options like Triple Mango and Blue Cotton Candy.</p>

  <div style=""background:#E5E5E5;padding:1rem;border-left:5px solid #CB9D64;margin:1.5rem 0;"">
    <h4>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:</h4>
    <p>If you're all about mouthfeel and smoother clouds, <strong>LOST MARY</strong> is built for satisfying draws with less throat harshness.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Performance & Battery Life</h3>
  <p>Both have similar performance on paper, but <strong>LOST MARY</strong> outlasts <strong>KRAZE</strong> slightly, thanks to more efficient draw technology. Battery and flavour taper more gradually as well.</p>

  <h3>Value for Money</h3>
  <p><strong>KRAZE</strong> is cheaper and hits hard from the start â€” great for users who want short-term impact. <strong>LOST MARY</strong> brings finesse, comfort, and better all-day usability.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p><strong>KRAZE 5000</strong> is great if you want bold hits and donâ€™t care as much about finish. But for refined flavour, comfort, and steady pacing, <strong>LOST MARY OS5000</strong> comes out on top.</p>

  <h2>KRAZE 5000 vs FLAVOUR BEAST UNLEASHED DCP 20K: In-Depth Review</h2>
  <p><em>Updated for 2025</em></p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Comparing the ultra-affordable <strong>KRAZE 5000</strong> to the high-end <strong>FLAVOUR BEAST UNLEASHED DCP 20K</strong> is like comparing a great weekend car to a luxury SUV. Both serve different needs, but how do they stack up when flavor and performance are on the line?</p>

  <h3>Design & Portability</h3>
  <p><strong>KRAZE 5000</strong> is lightweight and minimal â€” perfect for short-term use or on-the-go situations. The <strong>FLAVOUR BEAST UNLEASHED</strong> is larger and heavier, but packed with features like draw power control, adjustable airflow, and a digital puff tracker.</p>

  <h3>Flavour Experience</h3>
  <p><strong>FLAVOUR BEAST</strong> lives up to its name with intense, complex blends like Pink Fury and Arctic Peach. <strong>KRAZE</strong> holds its own, especially with icy fruit mixes, but doesnâ€™t offer the same layered flavour richness.</p>

  <div style=""background:#E5E5E5;padding:1rem;border-left:5px solid #CB9D64;margin:1.5rem 0;"">
    <h4>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:</h4>
    <p>If you want custom airflow and exact puff tracking, <strong>FLAVOUR BEAST UNLEASHED</strong> gives you pro-level features in a disposable.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Performance & Battery Life</h3>
  <p><strong>KRAZE</strong> tops out at 5000 puffs with decent flavour retention. <strong>FLAVOUR BEAST</strong> delivers a massive 20,000 puffs and is fully rechargeable, with smart airflow tuning for consistent clouds all the way through.</p>

  <h3>Value for Money</h3>
  <p><strong>KRAZE</strong> is a solid option for budget-conscious users or as a backup. <strong>FLAVOUR BEAST UNLEASHED</strong> costs more upfront, but the longevity and feature set make it worth every dollar for heavy users.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p><strong>KRAZE 5000</strong> is great for casual vapers or those testing the waters. But if youâ€™re serious about flavour, customization, and premium build quality, <strong>FLAVOUR BEAST UNLEASHED DCP 20K</strong> easily takes the crown.</p>

  <h3>Design & Portability</h3>
  <p><strong>GHOST XL</strong> is ultra-light, pen-sized, and simple â€” itâ€™s designed for quick use with no frills. <strong>STLTH VISION</strong> brings a larger format with a visible e-liquid window and LED indicators, offering more tech while still being pocket-friendly.</p>

  <h3>Flavour Experience</h3>
  <p><strong>GHOST XL</strong> nails familiar flavours like Peach Ice and Pineapple Coconut. Theyâ€™re smooth, consistent, and crowd-pleasing. <strong>STLTH VISION</strong>, however, uses STLTH pods, giving you a wider variety and higher-quality juice options overall.</p>

  <div style=""background:#E5E5E5;padding:1rem;border-left:5px solid #CB9D64;margin:1.5rem 0;"">
    <h4>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:</h4>

  </div>

  <h3>Performance & Battery Life</h3>

  <h3>Value for Money</h3>
  <p><strong>GHOST XL</strong> is cheaper and great for short-term use or quick backups. <strong>STLTH VISION</strong> gives more value over time, especially for consistent vapers who want better battery and flavour quality.</p>

  <h3>Design & Portability</h3>
  <p><strong>STLTH 3K</strong> is slim and lightweight â€” the definition of simple, discreet vaping. <strong>TITAN MAX</strong> is bulkier, more powerful, and built for high-performance use. Portability goes to 3K, but TITAN MAX is far more rugged.</p>

  <p>In the battle between reliable performance and premium refinement, <strong>GHOST MAX</strong> and <strong>STLTH TITAN PRO 15K</strong> represent two ends of the disposable vape spectrum. Letâ€™s see which one comes out on top in this high-performance face-off.</p>

  <h3>Design & Portability</h3>
  <p><strong>GHOST MAX</strong> is simple and efficient â€” compact enough to carry anywhere, with a matte finish and no distractions. <strong>TITAN PRO</strong> is STLTHâ€™s luxury line, with a polished look, puff counter, and a more substantial feel in the hand.</p>

  <h3>Flavour Experience</h3>
  <p><strong>GHOST MAX</strong> delivers clean, crisp flavour with minimal drop-off. Itâ€™s ideal for consistent flavour lovers. <strong>STLTH TITAN PRO</strong> brings deeper complexity to each puff â€” especially in profiles like Apple Lemon Ice and Double Berry Freeze.</p>

  <div style=""background:#E5E5E5;padding:1rem;border-left:5px solid #CB9D64;margin:1.5rem 0;"">
    <h4>ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:</h4>
    <p>If you appreciate premium flavour layering and puff tracking, <strong>STLTH TITAN PRO</strong> is worth every penny.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Performance & Battery Life</h3>
  <p><strong>GHOST MAX</strong> delivers consistent draw quality but is limited in puff count and reusability. <strong>STLTH TITAN PRO</strong> offers 15,000 puffs, is rechargeable, and maintains airflow and flavour strength until the last hit.</p>

  <h3>Value for Money</h3>
  <p><strong>GHOST MAX</strong> is ideal for budget-conscious vapers and casual users. <strong>STLTH TITAN PRO</strong> commands a higher price, but the experience and longevity make it a strong value for dedicated users.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p><strong>GHOST MAX</strong> is great for simplicity and dependability. But if youâ€™re looking for advanced features, richer flavours, and longer sessions, <strong>STLTH TITAN PRO 15K</strong> is the pro-level upgrade you deserve.</p>
